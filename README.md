**Marketing Data Automation Tool**

This project is a **Python-Automation Tool** that collects, cleans, processes and reports trending marketing data from public web sources. It was build to replace in the search for trending marketing topics that can be implemented especially
since the trends are backed by realtime data from a pipeline. 

The tools scrapes trending marketing related posts, **cleans** them then using post upvotes the data is **structured** using pandas and generates a CSV repport and a visual insight for decision making. 

**Problem Statement**

Growth and marketing teams spend a lot of time tracking trends, copying data spreadsheets, and producing basic reports. This process is repetitive and error-prone thus inefficient.

This automation:
- Scrapes public marketing trend data from the web
- Cleans and structures the data into a usable format
- Generates automated CSV reports
- Produces visual summaries using charts
- Runs end-to-end with a single command

**Technologies used**

Python 3
Requests & BeautifulSoup
Pandas – data cleaning and transformation
Matplotlib –  visualization
